HelixNet - 3D Protein Structure Prediction
This is my personal project to build a deep learning model that can predict the 3D structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence using PyTorch.
Right now (November 2025) the project is still under development.
What is already in the repository:

model.py (the neural network code - work in progress)
train.py (training script)
inference.py (will be used for prediction)
requirements.txt (list of Python packages you need)
Some example protein data and notebooks


How to set it up:

Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/LokheshNK/Helixnet--3D-Protein-Structure-Prediction.git
Go into the folder
cd Helixnet--3D-Protein-Structure-Prediction
Install the packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

What I plan to add very soon:

Fully working model
Pre-trained weights
Simple command to predict any protein from a FASTA file
Good documentation and examples
Google Colab notebook so anyone can try it without installing anything

If you are interested:

Give a star to the repository
Watch the repo for updates
I will push big updates every week

Feel free to open an issue if you have any questions.
